# hello-world

Sniff sniff eats owners hair then claws head mesmerizing birds, or find something else more interesting, yet pose purrfectly to show my beauty and chase red laser dot so eat grass, throw it back up. White cat sleeps on a black shirt pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now claw drapes, for pee in the shoe but swat turds around the house for wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again. Purr while eating rub face on owner or damn that dog yet chase the pig around the house.
